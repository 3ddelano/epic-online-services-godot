# Introduction

Epic Online Services Godot (EOSG) is the easiest way to integrate Epic Online Services into your Godot project.

The plugin supports the following platforms:

- Windows x64
- Linux x64/arm64
- Android x64/arm64
- MacOS universal
- iOS arm64 (iPhone/simulator)

This plugin has two main ways in which you can interact with Epic Online Services:

1. High Level EOS (Recommended)
2. GDExtension EOS


### High Level EOS (Recommended)

The High Level Epic Online Services provides easy-to-use methods and signals to interact with EOS, making it ideal for beginners. This simplified API abstracts away many of the complexities of the EOS SDK while providing access to its core functionality.


### GDExtension EOS

The GDExtension EOS provides low-level access to the Epic Online Services SDK. This interface is not recommended for beginners but gives you full access to the underlying EOS functionality through the `EOS` and `IEOS` classes in Godot.
