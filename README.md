How does it work
--------------

This project wraps the Epic Online Services C# SDK so that it can be easily used in Godot using GDScript, C#, etc with similar class hierarchy and static type support. It makes use of signals for sending events like user login, logout, achievement unlock, etc.


Requirements
--------------

> You need to have the **Mono version of Godot** to make use of this project. This doesn't mean you have to code in C#. You can code in any language that Godot supports.

- Mono version (C# support) of Godot Engine (Get it here [Godot Engine Download](https://godotengine.org/download))
- Mono Godot project
  Easily convert a normal GDScript project to Mono (Project Menu -> Tools -> C# -> Create C# Solution)
- EOS C# SDK (Download from [Epic Developer Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/sdk))
- Make sure you have accepted the Terms for [Epic Online Services](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/tos?lang=en-US)
- A product registered with Epic Games Services (Make one for free [Epic Developer Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal))


Getting Started
--------------
1. Download/clone the repo and copy the `EOS` folder to your own Godot project folder.

1. Download the `EOS C# SDK`, extract it, and copy and paste the `Source` and `Bin` folders to the `EOS` folder. The EOS folder should look something like this:
   
   <img src="./_media/eos_folder_structure.png">

1. Open the file, `res://EOS/Source/Core/Config.cs` and paste the following lines at the top and save the file 
   > You may get a permission warning saying that the file is Readonly. Make sure that the file gets saved/overwritten
   ```C
    #if GODOT_WINDOWS || GODOT_64
        #define EOS_PLATFORM_WINDOWS_64
    #elif GODOT_X11
        #define EOS_PLATFORM_LINUX
    #elif GODOT_OSX
        #define EOS_PLATFORM_OSX
    #elif GODOT_IOS
        #define EOS_PLATFORM_IOS
    #elif GODOT_ANDROID || __ANDROID__
        #define EOS_PLATFORM_ANDROID
    #else
        #error "Godot could not set the EOS target platform."
    #endif
   ``` 

1. In the res:// folder open the `{Project Name}.csproj` and add the following lines after the `</PropertyGroup>` to ensure that the EOS libraries will be automatically included in the exported project (you can further modify this to only include the library of the current platform):
   ```
   <ItemGroup>
     <DllFiles Include="EOS\Bin\**"/>
     <Reference Include="Microsoft.CSharp" />
   </ItemGroup>
   <Target Name="CopyCustomContent" AfterTargets="AfterBuild">
     <Copy SourceFiles="@(DllFiles)" DestinationFolder="$(OutDir)" SkipUnchangedFiles="true" />
   </Target>
   ```

2. Add the `IEOS.cs` file present in `EOS` folder as an autoload (Project Settings -> Autoload).
 
3. You can now use the methods/signals from the `EOS` class in Godot.
   
   Minimal Starting Boilerplate (See `Main.gd` and `LogsView.gd` in `Sample` for an example)
   ```GDScript
    func _ready():
        # Initialize the SDK
        var init_options = EOS.Platform.InitializeOptions.new()
        init_options.product_name = "PRODUCT_NAME_HERE"
        init_options.product_version = "PRODUCT_VERSION_HERE"

        var init_result: int = EOS.Platform.PlatformInterface.initialize(init_options)
        if init_result != EOS.Result.Success:
            print("Failed to initialize EOS SDK: ", EOS.print_result(init_result))
            return

        # Create platform
        var create_options = EOS.Platform.CreateOptions.new()
        create_options.product_id = "PRODUCT_ID_HERE"
        create_options.sandbox_id = "SANDBOX_ID_HERE"
        create_options.deployment_id = "DEPLOYMENT_ID_HERE"
        create_options.client_id = "CLIENT_ID_HERE"
        create_options.client_secret = "CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
        create_options.encryption_key = "ENCRYPTION_KEY_HERE"

        # Enable Social Overlay on Windows
        if OS.get_name() == "Windows":
            create_options.flags = EOS.Platform.PlatformFlags.WindowsEnableOverlayOpengl

        var create_result: bool = EOS.Platform.PlatformInterface.create(create_options)
        if not create_result:
            print("Failed to create EOS Platform")
            return

        # Setup Logs from EOS
        EOS.get_instance().connect("logging_interface_callback", self, "_on_logging_interface_callback")
        var res: int = EOS.Logging.set_log_level(EOS.Logging.LogCategory.AllCategories, EOS.Logging.LogLevel.Info)
        if res != EOS.Result.Success:
            print("Failed to set log level: ", EOS.print_result(res))
    
    func _on_logging_interface_callback(msg):
        msg = EOS.Logging.LogMessage.from(msg) as EOS.Logging.LogMessage
        
        print("SDK %s | %s" % [msg.category, msg.message])
   ```
4. **Using Account Portal to login to EOS**
   
   See <a href="#bootstrapping-godot-executable-with-epic-online-services">Bootstrapping Godot executable with Epic Online Services</a>

### How to run the sample project?
> The sample Godot project is located in the **Sample** folder

1. Copy the `EOS` folder into the `Sample` folder, then open `project.godot` in Godot mono.
1. Copy the credentials (Product Id, Sandbox Id, Deployment Id, Client Id, Client Secret) for your product from the Dev Portal and paste them in `Main.gd` script in the relevant `EOS.Platform.CreateOptions`. The encryption key is a random 64 character long string. These credentials need to be kept as private as possible. One way is to make sure to encrypt all scripts when exporting the final game. (See [Compiling with script key encryption](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/compiling_with_script_encryption_key.html))

1. Configure your Product on the EOS Dev Portal with the following configuration:
  - In the Client Policies section in Product Settings, enable all the features except Connect (Disabled by Epic)
  - In the Permissions section of Epic Account Services, enable all three: Basic Profile, Online Presence and Friends. 
  - (Optional if you want some pre-made achievements)  
  In the Achievements section in Game Services, use the Bulk Import option and import the `HelloProduct.zip` file located at `res://HelloProduct.zip`

### Bootstrapping Godot executable with Epic Online Services
If you want to use the Account Portal option to login in Epic Online Services, you need to bootstrap the Godot executable as needed by EOS-SDK 1.15 and greater. See [Redistributable Installer](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/EpicAccountServices/Crossplayacrossplatforms/RedistributableInstaller/index.html)

A sample of the generated .ini file is shown below:
```
ApplicationPath=Godot_v3.4.2-stable_mono_win64.exe
WorkingDirectory=
WaitForExit=0
NoOperation=0
```
Follow the instructions in [Running the service for local development](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/EpicAccountServices/Crossplayacrossplatforms/RedistributableInstaller/index.html#runningtheserviceforlocaldevelopment) and:
- When in development
  
  Bootstrap the Godot mono executable (eg. `Godot_v3.4.2-stable_mono_win64.exe`)
- When exporting the project
  
  Bootstrap the exported project executable (eg. `My Amazing Game.exe`)

# Support Development

### Making this project took a lot of time and effort, reading the EOS documentation countless times and testing each method in Godot. I would really appreciate if you could support the project in any way.
